# Mongo API Project ðŸ’»

In this project I created an API using Express. My API has a couple of RESTful endpoints which return some arrays of data and a single item.
Additionally, I used Mongoose library for MongoDB and Node.js. For testing purposes, I use Postman.

## In this project, you will find:

- Modeling data in Mongoose
- Fetching items from a Mongo database using Mongoose
- Seeding large amounts of data to a database

## Tools/ techniques, approach and planning ðŸ”¨

I created a RESTful API based on the netflix-titles.json data. If I had more time, I would create a frontend that uses my API.

## Deployed version ðŸš€
